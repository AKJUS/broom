Description: Convert statistical analysis objects from R into tidy format,
    so that they can more easily be combined, reshaped and otherwise processed
    with tools like dplyr and tidyr. The package provides three S3 generics:
    tidy, which summarizes a model's statistical findings such as coefficients
    of a regression, augment, which adds columns to the original data such as
    predictions, residuals and cluster assignments, and glance, which provides
    a one-row summary of model-level statistics.

    plyr,
    dplyr,

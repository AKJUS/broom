broom 0.2
---------

* Added "augment" S3 generic and various implementations. "augment" does something different from tidy: it adds columns to the original dataset, including predictions, residuals, or cluster assignments. This was originally described as "fortify" in ggplot2.
* Added "glance" S3 generic and various implementations. "glance" produces a *one-row* data frame summary, which is necessary for tidy outputs with values like R^2 or F-statistics.
* Re-wrote intro broom vignette/README to introduce all three methods.
* Wrote a new kmeans vignette.
* Added tidying methods for multcomp, sp, and map objects (from fortify-multcomp, fortify-sp, and fortify-map from ggplot2).
* Because this integrates substantial amounts of ggplot2 code (with permission), added Hadley Wickham as an author in DESCRIPTION.

following up on [GH issue](https://github.com/dgrtwo/broom/issues/38)

* have started updating `lme4` tidier
* is there/could there be any attempt to provide unification of column types, and row names across different model types?  is there a standard?  (different mixed model packages name random effects, fixed effects in different ways)
* what to do about expensive components (e.g. profile or parametric bootstrap CIs)?  Do any model types return CIs at this point?

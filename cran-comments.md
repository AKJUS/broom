## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have

* Removed 'require("maptools")' call that led to a NOTE on R-devel

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.1.2
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.1.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Reverse dependencies
Broom has no reverse dependencies.

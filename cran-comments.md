broom 0.3.7
-----------

## Changes

This is a re-submission:

* Put 'dplyr', 'tidyr' and 'ggplot2' in single quotes in DESCRIPTION

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

## Reverse dependencies
Broom has one reverse dependency, radiant. I ran R CMD check on radiant 0.1.83 with broom 0.3.7 and it showed no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.
